# Hey there, I'm Tej Gumaste!

I'm a curious builder, and a data-driven researcher pursuing my B.S. in **Computer Science** with a **Mathematics minor** at the University of Kansas. I’m passionate about solving problems at the intersection of software engineering, AI, and scientific discovery.

I'm currently interning @ Gemini Exchange in NYC. Feel free to hmu on LinkedIn (vide infra) if you're in NYC!

Outside of computer science, I love exploring new math concepts, playing badminton and travelling!!

I also dabble in Model United Nations sometimes!

Fun fact: I have been to 10+ countries and can speak 4 languages!

I believe that code is only as useful as the problems it solves and I'm constantly looking to tackle the next big thing!

## What I'm currently working on

I'm getting ready to graduate from college. Recently, I published an open source tool called PyCIFTer to enable large scale analysis of CIF crystal structures. I am continuing the development of this tool. Along with this tool I published a [peer-reviewed research paper](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/31/1/18) that showcases the utility of PyCIFTer.

## What I’m currently learning

I'm fascinated with low-level programming. I'm building skills in C++ and other low level language and I am busy making small and fast c++ applications!
