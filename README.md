# Hey there, I'm Tej Gumaste!

I'm a curious builder, and a data-driven researcher pursuing my B.S. in **Computer Science** with a **Mathematics minor** at the University of Kansas. I’m passionate about solving problems at the intersection of software engineering, AI, and scientific discovery.

I'm currently interning @ Gemini Exchange in NYC. Feel free to hmu on LinkedIn (vide infra) if you're in NYC!

Outside of computer science, I love exploring new math concepts, playing badminton and travelling!!

I also dabble in Model United Nations sometimes!

Fun fact: I have been to 10+ countries and can speak 4 languages!

I believe that code is only as useful as the problems it solves and I'm constantly looking to tackle the next big thing!

Feel free to reach out to me through [email](mailto:tej.gumaste@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/tej-gumaste)

## What I'm currently working on

I'm currently working on DAIM, which stands for decentralized AI marketplace. DAIM aims to be exactly as advertised, a Decentralized AI marketplace where you are the owner of your innovation. View the project [here](https://github.com/Vegito2367/DAIM). Its my attempt at making AI more transparent for everyone.
